LSL Plus is a plugin for the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> platform.
The plugin allows editing, 'compiling' and testing of your
<a href="http://www.secondlife.com">Second Life®</a> Linden Scripting Language
(<a href="http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LSL_Portal">LSL</a>) code.  LSL Plus originated
as a project to create an 'executable semantics' in Haskell for LSL (just for the fun of it... as everyone
knows there's nothing more fun than programming language semantics) and evolved into this plugin (and no
longer looks much like an executable semantics).</p>

<p>
The plugin is <em>intended</em> to be cross platform.  It <em>should</em> be able to work on at the
very least the Win32 platform, the Mac OSX platform, and on Linux.  Releases are generally produced
for all these platforms; for other platforms, you may have to <a href="installation.html#build-it">build a portion of the plugin yourself</a>.<p>

<p>
Because it is an Eclipse plugin, when you use LSL Plus you can take advantage of many of the useful features
of Eclipse.  Integrated support of a source code control system such as CVS or Subversion comes for
&quot;free&quot;, and there are many other features -- task list management, integration with bug tracking
tools, etc.  You will of course need to make sure you get the appropriate plugins to use these features.
