<h1>Launching LSL Code</h1>
<p>
Once you have created some LSL scripts or modules, you will want to test and debug those scripts.  To do
this you must run, or launch, the code.  There are three things in LSL Plus that can be launched:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Standalone scripts</li>
<li>Unit tests</li>
<li>Sim projects</li>
</ul>

<p>Launching a standalone script offers a minimal set of functionality: the script runs in a simulated
world in which it is the sole script contained within the sole prim of the sole object in a region.
There will be one avatar in the region, named "Default Avatar".  The script will run as expected:
it will enter the <em>default</em> state, and it's state_entry event handler will run.  Then it will
sit and wait for something to happen.  There is a UI which will allow you to send events to the script
(like touch events, for example).  It won't have any inventory to work with, or other script to interact
with.  To launch a script, you use the 'Run' or 'Debug' menu item in the context menu in the Navigator
view:</p>

<p>Launching a <a href="unit-test.html">unit test</a> allows you to perform narrowly target tests of individual functions or
handlers in your modules and scripts.  The entire LSL environment is 'mocked-up' -- you specify the
results of any 'LL' function calls in the test (aside from purely 'internal' functions, such as the
mathematical functions, list and string functions, etc.) so that you can completely control the progress
of the test.  The launching works the same way -- select a test file, and right click to get the 
context menu, then select the Run/Debug submenu and launch the test.<p>

<p>Launching a <a href="sim-project.html">simulator project</a> allows you to test multiple scripts in an
environment that you specify, with multiple objects, prims, avatars, inventory items, available.  The 
lauching works the same way: pick a sim project file (.simp file) and use the context menu to launch it.
